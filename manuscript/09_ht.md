# Hypothesis testing
Hypothesis testing is concerned with making decisions using data.

## Hypothesis testing
[Watch this video before beginning.](http://youtu.be/Wqvx6_12ZMs?list=PLpl-gQkQivXiBmGyzLrUjzsblmQsLtkzJ)

To make decisions using data, we need to characterize the kinds of conclusions
we can make. Classical hypothesis testing is concerned with deciding between
two decisions (things get much harder if there's more than two).
The first, a null hypothesis is specified that represents the status quo.
This hypothesis is usually labeled, {$$}H_0{/$$}. This is what we assume
by default. The alternative or
research hypothesis is what we require evidence to conclude. This hypothesis is usually labeled, {$$}H_a{/$$} or sometimes {$$}H_1{/$$} (or some other number other than 0).

So to reiterate,
the null hypothesis is assumed true and statistical evidence is required
  to reject it in favor of a research or alternative hypothesis

### Example
A respiratory disturbance index (RDI) of more than 30 events / hour, say, is
considered evidence of severe sleep disordered breathing (SDB).
Suppose that in a sample of 100 overweight subjects with other
risk factors for sleep disordered breathing at a sleep clinic, the
mean RDI was 32 events / hour with a standard deviation of 10 events / hour.

We might want to test the hypothesis that

{$$}H_0 : \mu = 30{/$$}

versus the hypothesis

{$$} H_a : \mu > 30 {/$$}

where {$$}\mu{/$$} is the population mean RDI. Clearly, somehow we must
figure out a way to decide between these hypotheses using the observed data,
particularly the sample mean.

Before we go through the specifics, let's set up the central ideas.


## Types of errors in hypothesis testing

The alternative hypotheses are typically of the form
of the true mean being {$$}<{/$$}, {$$}>{/$$} or {$$}\neq{/$$} to the hypothesized
mean, such as {$$} H_a : \mu > 30 {/$$} from our example. The null typically
sharply specifies the mean, such as {$$}H_0 : \mu = 30{/$$} in our example.
More complex null hypotheses are possible, but are typically
covered in later courses.

Note that there are four possible outcomes of our statistical decision process:

|Truth        | Decide       | Result                |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------------|
|{$$}H_0{/$$} | {$$}H_0{/$$} | Correctly accept null |
|{$$}H_0{/$$} | {$$}H_a{/$$} | Type I error          |
|{$$}H_a{/$$} | {$$}H_a{/$$} | Correctly reject null |
|{$$}H_a{/$$} | {$$}H_0{/$$} | Type II error         |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------------|

We will perform hypothesis testing by forcing the probability of a
Type I error to be  small. This approach consequences, which we can discuss
with an analogy to court cases.


## Discussion relative to court cases

Consider a court of law and a criminal case. The null hypothesis is that the
defendant is innocent. The rules requires a standard on the available
evidence to reject the null hypothesis (and the jury to convict). The standard is specified
loosely in this case, such as convict if the defendant appears guilty
"Beyond reasonable doubt". In statistics, we can be mathematically
specific about our standard of evidence.

Note the consequences of setting a standard. If we set a low standard, say
convicting only if there circumstantial or greater evidence,
then we would increase the percentage of innocent people convicted (type I errors).
However, we would also increase the percentage of guilty people convicted
(correctly rejecting the null).

If we set a high standard, say the standard of convicting if the jury has
"No doubts whatsoever", then we increase the the
percentage of innocent people let free (correctly accepting the
null) while we would also increase the percentage of guilty people
let free (type II errors).

## Building up a standard of evidence

Consider our sleep example again. A reasonable strategy would reject the null hypothesis if
the sample mean, {$$}\bar X{/$$}, was larger than some constant, say {$$}C{/$$}.

Typically, {$$}C{/$$} is chosen so that the probability of a Type I
  error, labeled {$$}\alpha{/$$}, is {$$}0.05{/$$} (or some other relevant constant)

To reiterate, {$$}\alpha = {/$$} Type I error rate = Probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when, in fact, the null hypothesis is correct

Let's see if we can figure out what {$$}C{/$$} has to be.
The standard error of the mean is {$$}10 / \sqrt{100} = 1{/$$}.
Furthermore, under {$$}H_0{/$$} we know that {$$}\bar X \sim N(30, 1){/$$}
(at least approximately) via the CLT.
We want to chose {$$}C{/$$} so that the

{$$}P(\bar X > C; H_0)=0.05{/$$}

The 95th percentile of a normal distribution is 1.645
standard deviations from the mean. So, if  {$$}C{/$$}
is set 1.645 standard deviations from the mean, we should be set
since the probability of getting a sample mean that large is only
5%. The 95th percentile from a {$$}N(30, 1){/$$} is:

{$$}
C = 30 + 1 \times 1.645 = 31.645
{/$$}

So the rule "Reject {$$}H_0{/$$} when {$$}\bar X \geq 31.645{/$$}"
has the property that the probability of rejection
is 5% when {$$}H_0{/$$} is true.

In general, however, we don't convert {$$}C{/$$} back to the original scale.
Instead, we calculate how many standard errors the observed mean is
from the hypothesized mean

{$$}
Z = \frac{\bar X - \mu_0}{s / \sqrt{n}}.
{/$$}

This is called a Z-score. We can compare this statistic to standard
normal quantiles.

To reiterate, the Z-score is how many
standard errors the sample mean is above the hypothesized mean. In our
example:

{$$}
\frac{32 - 30}{10 / \sqrt{100}} = 2
{/$$}

Since 2 is greater than 1.645 we would reject. Setting the rule "We reject
if our Z-score is larger than 1.645" controls the Type I error rate at 5%.
We could write out a general rule for this alternative hypothesis as
reject whenever {$$}\sqrt{n} (\bar X - \mu_0) / s > Z_{1-\alpha}{/$$} where
{$$}\alpha{/$$} is the desired Type I error rate.

Because the Type I error rate was controlled to be small,
if we reject we know that one of the following occurred:

1. the null hypothesis is false,
2. we observed an unlikely event in support of the alternative even though the null is true,
3. our modeling assumptions are wrong.

The third option can be difficult to check and at some level all bets are off
depending on how wrong we are about our basic assumptions.
So for this course, we speak of our conclusions
under the assumption that our modeling choices (such as the iid
sampling model) are correct, but do so wide eyed acknowledging the limitations
of our approach.

## General rules
We developed our test for one possible alternatives. Here's some general
rules for the three most important alternatives.

The {$$}Z{/$$} test for {$$}H_0:\mu = \mu_0{/$$} versus

  * {$$}H_1: \mu < \mu_0{/$$}
  * {$$}H_2: \mu \neq \mu_0{/$$}
  * {$$}H_3: \mu > \mu_0{/$$}

Test statistic

{$$}TS = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu_0}{S / \sqrt{n}}{/$$}

Reject the null hypothesis when

  * {$$}TS \leq Z_{\alpha} = -Z_{1 - \alpha}{/$$}
  * {$$}|TS| \geq Z_{1 - \alpha / 2}{/$$}
  * {$$}TS \geq Z_{1 - \alpha}{/$$}

<!--
### Notes
* We have fixed $\alpha$ to be low, so if we reject {$$}H_0{/$$} (either
  our model is wrong) or there is a low probability that we have made
  an error
* We have not fixed the probability of a type II error, $\beta$;
  therefore we tend to say ``Fail to reject {$$}H_0{/$$}'' rather than
  accepting {$$}H_0{/$$}
* Statistical significance is no the same as scientific
  significance
* The region of TS values for which you reject {$$}H_0{/$$} is called the
  rejection region

## More notes
* The $Z$ test requires the assumptions of the CLT and for $n$ to be large enough
  for it to apply
* If $n$ is small, then a Gossett's *t* test is performed exactly in the same way,
  with the normal quantiles replaced by the appropriate Student's *t* quantiles and
  $n-1$ df
* The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false is called *power*
* Power is a used a lot to calculate sample sizes for experiments

---
## Example reconsidered
- Consider our example again. Suppose that $n= 16$ (rather than
$100$)
- The statistic
$$
\frac{\bar X - 30}{s / \sqrt{16}}
$$
follows a *t* distribution with 15 df under {$$}H_0{/$$}
- Under {$$}H_0{/$$}, the probability that it is larger
that the 95th percentile of the *t* distribution is 5%
- The 95th percentile of the T distribution with 15
df is 1.7531 (obtained via `qt(.95, 15)`)
- So that our test statistic is now $\sqrt{16}(32 - 30) / 10 = 0.8 $
- We now fail to reject.

---
## Two sided tests
* Suppose that we would reject the null hypothesis if in fact the  mean was too large or too small
* That is, we want to test the alternative $H_a : \mu \neq 30$
* We will reject if the test statistic, $0.8$, is either too large or too small
* Then we want the probability of rejecting under the
null to be 5%, split equally as 2.5% in the upper
tail and 2.5% in the lower tail
* Thus we reject if our test statistic is larger
than `qt(.975, 15)` or smaller than `qt(.025, 15)`
  * This is the same as saying: reject if the
  absolute value of our statistic is larger than
  `qt(0.975, 15)` = 2.1314
  * So we fail to reject the two sided test as well
  * (If you fail to reject the one sided test, you
  know that you will fail to reject the two sided)

## T test in R

```r
library(UsingR); data(father.son)
t.test(father.son$sheight - father.son$fheight)
```

```
>
> 	One Sample t-test
>
> data:  father.son$sheight - father.son$fheight
> t = 11.79, df = 1077, p-value < 2.2e-16
> alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0
> 95 percent confidence interval:
>  0.831 1.163
> sample estimates:
> mean of x
>     0.997
```

---
## Connections with confidence intervals
* Consider testing $H_0: \mu = \mu_0$ versus $H_a: \mu \neq \mu_0$
* Take the set of all possible values for which you fail to reject {$$}H_0{/$$}, this set is a $(1-\alpha)100\%$ confidence interval for $\mu$
* The same works in reverse; if a $(1-\alpha)100\%$ interval
  contains $\mu_0$, then we *fail  to* reject {$$}H_0{/$$}

---
## Two group intervals
- First, now you know how to do two group T tests
since we already covered indepedent group T intervals
- Rejection rules are the same
- Test $H_0 : \mu_1 = \mu_2$
- Let's just go through an example

---
## `chickWeight` data
Recall that we reformatted this data

```r
library(datasets); data(ChickWeight); library(reshape2)
##define weight gain or loss
wideCW <- dcast(ChickWeight, Diet + Chick ~ Time, value.var = "weight")
names(wideCW)[-(1 : 2)] <- paste("time", names(wideCW)[-(1 : 2)], sep = "")
library(dplyr)
wideCW <- mutate(wideCW,
  gain = time21 - time0
)
```

---
### Unequal variance T test comparing diets 1 and 4

```r
wideCW14 <- subset(wideCW, Diet %in% c(1, 4))
t.test(gain ~ Diet, paired = FALSE,
       var.equal = TRUE, data = wideCW14)
```

```
>  
>  	Two Sample t-test
>  
>  data:  gain by Diet
>  t = -2.725, df = 23, p-value = 0.01207
>  alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
>  95 percent confidence interval:
>   -108.15  -14.81
>  sample estimates:
>  mean in group 1 mean in group 4
>            136.2           197.7
```

## Exact binomial test
- Recall this problem, *Suppose a friend has $8$ children, $7$ of which are girls and none are twins*
- Perform the relevant hypothesis test. $H_0 : p = 0.5$ $H_a : p > 0.5$
  - What is the relevant rejection region so that the probability of rejecting is (less than) 5%?

Rejection region | Type I error rate |
---|---|
[0 : 8] | 1
[1 : 8] | 0.9961
[2 : 8] | 0.9648
[3 : 8] | 0.8555
[4 : 8] | 0.6367
[5 : 8] | 0.3633
[6 : 8] | 0.1445
[7 : 8] | 0.0352
[8 : 8] | 0.0039

---
## Notes
* It's impossible to get an exact 5% level test for this case due to the discreteness of the binomial.
  * The closest is the rejection region [7 : 8]
  * Any alpha level lower than 0.0039 is not attainable.
* For larger sample sizes, we could do a normal approximation, but you already knew this.
* Two sided test isn't obvious.
  * Given a way to do two sided tests, we could take the set of values of $p_0$ for which we fail to reject to get an exact binomial confidence interval (called the Clopper/Pearson interval, BTW)
* For these problems, people always create a P-value (next lecture) rather than computing the rejection region.
